  <h2>Data Types in JavaScript</h2>

  <h4>Number</h4>
  <p>The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
    There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
    Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN</p>
  <h4>BigInt</h4>
  <p>In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(-253-1) for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.
    For most purposes that’s quite enough, but sometimes we need really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.
    BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.</p>
  <h4>String</h4>
  <p> Strings are used for storing text. Strings must be inside of either double or single quotes. In JS, Strings are immutable (they cannot be changed).
    A string is a collection of alphanumeric characters. I start a string by typing double quotes, single quotes, or the backtick character. Double quote and single quote behave identically, and the backtick character comes with some extra functionality</p>
  <h4>Boolean</h4>
  <p>The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.</p>
  <h4>The “null” value</h4>
  <p>In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.
    It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.</p>
  <h4>The “undefined” value</h4>
  <p>The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.
    The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
    If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined</p>
